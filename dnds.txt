# Description

Takes the SKADS catalogue by Wilman 2008 and produces a 5th order polynomial
parameterisation of log10(S^2.5 dN/dS) at 154 MHz for 1e-7.5 < S < 1e-3.

To do this, it corrects for frequency (151 -> 154 MHz) using a spectral index of 0.8. And
multiplies flux by 1.17 for continuity with Franzen's 2019 parameterisation > 1 mJy.
